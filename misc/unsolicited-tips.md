## Unsolicited Phone Tips

- Use Olauncher for your home screen
- Get a 5GB/month phone plan - you probably will not even use this much, or anywhere close to it
- Disable network access in Settings for any apps that do not logically need internet (camera, notes if saved locally, etc.)
- Likewise for disabling "Allow in background" for non-notification apps
- Turn on "Bold text" in "Display -> Display size and text"
- Don't use touch ID/face ID and instead unlock w/ a 6-digit passcode, with the "scramble passcode" setting turned on. This way you are making a choice to unlock your phone.
- Disable animations in accessibility settings. You will be surprised how much this strips away the illusion that the phone is a vast "place" you can "navigate".
- Put a matte cover on your screen - it helps with glare outside and the screen will not have the smartphone shiny-ness
- Put a sturdy case on it so the hardware lasts, and get a bright case or put bright tape on the case so you do not lose it
- Use a maps app that supports offline map downloads (almost all of them do now). Good for many reasons, most are obvious
- Set an alarm or calendar event in your phone to check things like work email, bank account, etc. on your computer, however often you need to check them
- Go outside to see what the weather is
    - If there is some major disaster or crisis nearby, they will send a public alert through the cell network - you would not need a weather app or browser to find that out. (speaking from US context)
- Bandcamp (music) and Libro.fm (audiobooks) are good for buying audio files you actually own and can listen to without installing apps - you just load them onto the phone's filesystem and the system music app recognizes them
- Aegis app + hardware key cover virtually all 2fa needs. Just one or the other will still cover like 90%
