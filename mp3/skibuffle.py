# STEPS

# Takes as input: a folder containing bandcamp-sourced mp3 files
# make copies of the files with below changes:
# move metadata and cover art to a field that is not parse-able to music apps
# rename each mp3 file as a random 8-digit combination while moving the true title to the above metadata field
# write the shuffle folder to /Music on the LineageOS device
# Output: an ipod shuffle-like playlist "album" in the LineageOS music app (Twelve) containing mp3 (or better) files

# the new metadata field should be searchable so user can find a certain song when they want
