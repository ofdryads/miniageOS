The sp parameter is used to filter the search results based on specific features. It is base64-encoded, and when decoded, it specifies what kind of filtering or sorting YouTube should apply.

Decoded value of sp=EgIwAQ%253D%253D:

When decoded from Base64, the value EgIwAQ%253D%253D becomes EgIwAQ==. This corresponds to the filter for Creative Commons (CC) videos.

    EgIwAQ== is a specific YouTube filter code that tells YouTube to show only videos uploaded under a Creative Commons license. The specific encoding ensures that the search results will show only videos that are marked by the uploader as being Creative Commons licensed.

2. Use the YouTube API to Check Each Video's License:

You can use the YouTube Data API v3 to get information about each video in a playlist, including its license. Here's how you could do it programmatically:

Step 1: Use the API to retrieve the playlist videos.
Step 2: For each video, use the API to check the license field in the video's metadata.

If the license is creativeCommon, itâ€™s a Creative Commons video.
