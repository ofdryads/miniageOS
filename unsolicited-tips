- Install Olauncher or set big text & icons in Settings if using the default launcher
- Get a 5GB/month phone plan - you probably will not even use this much, or anywhere close
- Disallow network access for apps that do not logically need internet (camera, notes if saved locally, etc.)
- Put a matte cover on your screen - it helps with glare outside and the screen will not look shiny
- Put a sturdy case on it so the hardware lasts, and put a bright case or bright tape on the case so you do not lose it
