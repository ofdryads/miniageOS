## Unsolicited Phone Tips

- Install Olauncher, or make the text & icons very big in Settings if using the default launcher
- Get a 5GB/month phone plan - you probably will not even use this much, or anywhere close to it
- Disable network access in Settings for any apps that do not logically need internet (camera, notes if saved locally, etc.)
- Likewise for disabling "Allow in background" for non-notification apps
- Disable animations in accessibility settings. You will be surprised how much this rips away the illusion that the phone is a vast "place" you can "navigate". 
- Put a matte cover on your screen - it helps with glare outside and the screen will not have the smartphone shiny-ness
- Put a sturdy case on it so the hardware lasts, and get a bright case or put bright tape on the case so you do not lose it
- Set an alarm or calendar event in your phone to check things like email, bank, etc. on your computer, however often you need to check them
- Bandcamp (music) and Libro.fm (audiobooks) are good for buying audio files you actually own and can listen to without installing apps
- Aegis + hardware key cover virtually all 2fa needs. Just one or the other will still cover like 90%
